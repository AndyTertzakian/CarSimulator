# CarSimulator
A simple game which is played through the command line.

The general premise of the game is that there are two cars racing against each other: A race car and ATV. During the race, one player mans
each car. Players must watch there remaining fuel, as well as consider other factors (such as the randomly generated weather conditions) and
decide how they want to gamble their chances at winning.

The race car is racing in a desert, and the ATV is racing in a tundra terrain. Every turn there is a chance of the race car being hit by
a heat wave, and the ATV being hit by a blizzard. If the players do not choose to change car modes going into that round, they might feel
the negative effects of the weather!
